# MiniVKBot
This is a small script for the VKontakte page, allowing you to use locks without entering the user's page.

This script can not be considered serious, because it is made for the sake of a joke. 

To run, just enter your token and run the file through: python <Main.py> (There will be no response in the Terminal)
